    "|Compiler translates the entire high level language program into the machine language program at once before executing. This optimizes the use of machine language instructions in the translated program. Therefore normally compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs. The original high level language program is called as _source program_. The compiled program i.e. machine language program generated by the compiler after translation is called object program. | The interpreter translates the program written in high level languages into machine language at the time of executing that program, instructions by instructions. That is, it reads the first instruction written in the program and converts that into equivalent machine language instructions. Then the CPU watches those machine language instructions. After that, the Interpreter reads and translates the next instruction and so on.|\n",
    "|Compiler takes _entire_ program as input.| Interpreter takes _single_ instructions as input|\n",

    "|It required large space in the computer.| Interpreter are easy to write and do not require large memory space.|\n",
    "|Speed of a compiler is very fast.|Speed is very slow.|\n",
    "|Any change in source program after the compilation requires recompiling of entire code.| Any change in source program during the translation does not require's retranslation of entire code.|\n",
    "|Intermediate Object code is generated.| No intermediate Object Code is generated|\n",
    "|Conditional control statements are executed faster.|Conditional Control statements are executed slower.\n",
    "|Memory requirement is more (since object code is generated)|Memory requirement is less.|\n",
